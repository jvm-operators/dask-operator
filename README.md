# Quick Start

Run the `spark-operator` deployment:
```bash
kubectl create -f manifest/operator.yaml
```

Create new cluster from the prepared example:

```bash
kubectl create -f examples/cluster.yaml
```

After issuing the commands above, you should be able to see a new Spark cluster running in the current namespace.

```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-spark-cluster-m-5kjtj           1/1       Running   0          10s
my-spark-cluster-w-m8knz           1/1       Running   0          10s
my-spark-cluster-w-vg9k2           1/1       Running   0          10s
spark-operator-510388731-852b2     1/1       Running   0          27s
```

Once you don't need the cluster anymore, you can delete it by deleting the config map resource by:
```bash
kubectl delete cm my-spark-cluster
```

# Very Quick Start

```bash
# create operator
kubectl create -f http://bit.ly/sparkop

# create cluster
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  labels:
    radanalytics.io/kind: cluster
data:
  config: |-
    workerNodes: "2"
EOF
```

### OpenShift

For deployment on OpenShift use the same commands as above, but with `oc` instead of `kubectl`.
